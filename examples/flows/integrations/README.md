# Integrations Folder

This folder contains flow examples contributed by various contributors. Each flow example should have a README.md file that provides a comprehensive introduction to the flow and includes contact information for the flow owner.

# Guideline for README.md of flows

You can also refer to the [README.md](../standard/web-classification/README.md) file in the [web-classification](../standard/web-classification) flow example as a reference.

Note: Above sample README.md may not have contact information because it's a shared example and people can open issues to this repository if they have any questions about the flow example. For integration samples, **please make sure to include contact information in your README.md file**.

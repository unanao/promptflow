        This method analyzes the `inputs_mapping` to ascertain the origin of the inputs for a batch operation.
        The `inputs_mapping` should be a dictionary with keys representing input names and values specifying the sources
        of these inputs. Inputs can originate from direct data or from the outputs of a previous run.

        The `inputs_mapping` is dictated entirely by the external caller. For more details on column mapping, refer to
        https://aka.ms/pf/column-mapping. The mapping can include references to both the inputs and outputs of previous
        runs, using a reserved source name 'run' to indicate such references. However, this method specifically checks
        for references to outputs of previous runs, which are denoted by values starting with "${run.outputs". When such
        a reference is found, the `batch_input_source` attribute of the OperationContext instance is set to "Run" to
        reflect that the batch operation is utilizing outputs from a prior run.

        If no values in the `inputs_mapping` start with "${run.outputs", it is inferred that the inputs do not derive
        from a previous run, and the `batch_input_source` is set to "Data".

        Examples of `inputs_mapping`:
            - Referencing a previous run's output:
                {'input1': '${run.outputs.some_output}', 'input2': 'direct_data'}
              In this case, 'input1' is sourced from a prior run's output, and 'input2' is from direct data.
              The `batch_input_source` would be set to "Run".

            - Sourcing directly from data:
                {'input1': 'data_source1', 'input2': 'data_source2'}
              Since no values start with "${run.outputs", the `batch_input_source` is set to "Data".

        Args:
            inputs_mapping (Mapping[str, str]): A dictionary mapping input names to their sources, where the sources
            can be either direct data or outputs from a previous run. The structure and content of this mapping are
            entirely under the control of the external caller.
